          <h2>The why:</h2>
          <p>The owner of Healing Waters Chiropractic wanted a professional website for her Chiropractic practice. She wanted to be able to make small changes 
              to the site without having deal with editing HTML or CSS. I chose to use Webflow to meet the clients needs. </p>

          <h2>Challenges and things to improve:</h2>
          <p>The challenge for this project was learning a platform I had not used before in order to meet client needs. Luckily, the Webflow documentation was
              easy to navigate and did not slow down the expected speed or progress of the project. For this site I also made sure that it met WCAG guidelines for
              accessibility. The one challenge here was the client was intent on the color selection so there are some contrast issues that exist. There are plans to
              add a high contrast mode to the site once the client is ready.

          <h2>Healing Waters Chiropractic</h2>
          <p>
            "I didn't have a website plan or even know where to begin.  Christina guided me through 
            the creative process and took the time to get to know me to create a website that represented 
            me and my business perfectly! She is very knowledgeable and working with her was a very enjoyable 
            experience. Christina was able to take my feedback and shape and redirect what I was asking for 
            in a productive and realistic way which produced a perfect end result. Not only am I proud of my 
            website but it has helped grow my business very quickly due to the ease at which appointments 
            can be made by the website visitor. She really gave me the best of her knowledge while valuing 
            what I wanted and needed.  Her work is the best investment you can make for your business."

          <h2>Water Crisis Project</h2>
          <p>
            "She did an incredible job. I didn’t even know what I wanted for the website but the 
            project is incredibly important to me and I knew I needed to pursue it. I changed my mind 
            several times because I could not narrow down what I wanted. Christina helped to give me a 
            vision to build the website to help others. She was very patient and offered solutions to 
            every issue along the way. We now have a platform to help the people in Flint because of 
            Christina’s work. I would recommend her services to my family and colleagues."

          <h2>The Why:</h2>
            <p>This project was built as a result of being contacted by the Water Crisis Project(WCP). WCP is working to provide residents of Flint, MI with 
            water filters so that they can filter their contaminated water. The client wanted a simple site that they could link on their social media that would
            inform people of their goals and direct donations to the Water Crisis Project gofundme account. 
            </p>

          <h2>Tech/features used:</h2>
          <p>HTML/CSS, scrollsnap, progressive enhancement, hosted on Firebase </p>
        </div>
        <div id='other-links'>
          <h2>Challenges and things to improve:</h2>
          <p>Because the Water Crisis project is a non-profit, they wanted a cheap hosting option so more dollars would be able to go to the people of Flint.
              In order to fulfill this admirable goal I chose to have their site hosted on Firebase which provides free hosting for smaller projects.

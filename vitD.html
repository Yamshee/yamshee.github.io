        <h2>The Why:</h2>
        <p>I built this because I was diagnosed with VERY low vitamin D and wanted to improve my vitamin D levels. When I went to try to find a way to determine
            how long I needed to be in the sun to get my daily amount I found there was no easy way to calculate the amount of time I needed to spend outside.
            The app takes in a persons skin type and uses the Mapbox api to search for a locations coordinates which are then forwarded to the DarkSky API to 
            determine current UV Index. From there the app displays the amount of time they need to spend in the sun to get their vitamin D 
            for the day. 
        </p>
      <div>
        <h2>Tech/features used:</h2>
        <p>HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Netlify, Darksky and Mapbox API, Axios, Amazon Lambda Functions</p>
      </div>
      <div id='other-links'>
        <h2>Challenges and things to improve:</h2>
        <p>My challenge here was creating an app I could share without exposing my either of my API keys. This is where Netlify and the Lambda functions came into play.
            The API keys are stored on Netlify and when the user makes a search, Netlify plugs in the values. In the future I would like to limit the amount of requests a user can make
            and store previous searches that have occurred in the last hour to limit the number of API calls. I would also like to publish this app, however Darksky has been acquired by Apple and I
            only have access to this API until the end of 2021.
